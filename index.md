# Harish's User Page
## Who am I?
**Hello there!** My name is Harish Vasanth, a second year Computer Science student. I really enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them better.

### Hobbies and Interests
Of course, I love [programming](#programming-experience), so some fun stuff first!

> ~ Shulk, Xenoblade Chronicles

I am a huge fan of video games in general, especially anything Nintendo. Some of my absolute favorite games include:
- Essentially everything in Xenoblade Chronicles series (look at [this](xc3image.jpg)!!!)
- Hollow Knight
- the many 3D Mario games
- same as the previous point except with Zelda
- *more that I don't remember since the list will get too long*

I also enjoy trying new things, always looking for something to spice things up. That being said I have a hard time actually deciding on and committing to something new. And of course, I enjoy hanging out with my friends.

## Programming Experience
Most of my experience with programming is with C++, C, Python, and Java. I have a couple different interests right now (AI, systems programming, etc.) and am looking forward to learning about the *many* different areas of CS!

My favorite languages in order would probably be something like:
1. C++ or Python
2. C
3. Java

Obviously each language has their own strengths and uses for different purposes, so its nice to become comfortable with multiple (as they all share similarities). I do find Java's syntax to be annoyingly verbose sometimes with all the ``` private static final LongObjectName RANDOM_CONST = ...``` and ```public static void main``` that might need to be typed, but for the most part, its definitely manageable.

I also joined **Engineers for Exploration** during fall quarter of this year, in particular the FishSense team. I've grown to really like the research experience, and I felt that its been an incredible way to apply some of the skills I've been learning as part of my classes. I've also learned about how to use different libraries that I previously had not touched before (openCV, depthai, etc.). 

My focus in FishSense currently (extending from last quarter, where I took CSE 199) is to evaluate one of the cameras that we are considering using in our underwater enclosure and determine whether it is worthwhile. I have also written Python scripts to calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall of our fish identification model.

I have some machine learning experience, both through work with ACM AI Projects, CSE 152A (computer vision), and prior experience.

## My Goals for the Future
In the future, I hope to become a great software engineer and have the chance to work on a variety of strong projects. I would also love the chance to learn about a variety of different tools and areas of CS, and hopefully make a strong impact :)

**Hopes for CSE 110:**

- [ ]  Get work experience as part of group
- [ ]  Make some new friends
- [ ]  **Create a fun project!**
